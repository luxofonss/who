  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio string and corresponding text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy.  The service uses a `pronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client) to communicate with an external service for pronunciation analysis. The response from the external service is mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object before being returned to the client.  Error handling is implemented for cases where the external service returns null, throwing a `BusinessException`.",

      "explain": "The endpoint accepts audio (base64 encoded) and text.  The `PronunciationService` processes this data and returns an accuracy assessment. However, the details of the `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` are not fully specified, impacting the score.  We need to see the structure of `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` to confirm full coverage of all required details in the accuracy report."

The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said. An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced. The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech. A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Needs Improvement\"). A numerical score representing my pronunciation accuracy. The exact original text and its phonetic representation that I was supposed to say.",
      "coverage_score": 10,

      "explain": "The code includes error handling: `if (response == null) { throw new BusinessException(ErrorConstant.GET_PRONUNCIATION_ACCURACY_ERROR); }`.  This throws an exception if the external service fails.  The exact message returned to the user depends on the `BusinessException` and `BaseResponse` handling, which needs further investigation."
