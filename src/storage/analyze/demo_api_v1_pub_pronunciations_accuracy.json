  "document": "The REST endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` accepts a POST request with a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` in the body. This request object contains a Base64 encoded audio string (`base64Audio`) and the corresponding text (`text`). The endpoint delegates the pronunciation accuracy assessment to the `PronunciationService`.  The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` to send the request to an external service. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object.  The `BaseResponse` includes a request ID for tracing and error handling. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` which is caught by a global exception handler.",
