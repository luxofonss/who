  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/hello` is not directly shown in the provided code. However, the code snippets reveal a `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` endpoint that handles pronunciation accuracy assessment. This endpoint receives a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` containing base64 encoded audio and the corresponding text.  It uses the `pronunciationService` to delegate the accuracy check to a `pronunciationFeignClient`, likely an external service. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned within a `BaseResponse` object. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` and a custom exception handler.",
