  "document": "The REST endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` accepts a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` containing base64 encoded audio and text as input. It uses the `PronunciationService` to process this request. The service maps the request DTO to a `PronunciationAccuracyRequest` object, sets the language to \"en\", and sends it to a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for an external pronunciation service). The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object.  Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` for internal errors and `HttpStatusCodeException` for errors from the external service.  The response includes metadata such as request ID, and error details if any. AOP logging is implemented around the service method to log requests and responses.",
