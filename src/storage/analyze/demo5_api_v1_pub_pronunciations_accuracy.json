  "document": "The REST endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` accepts a POST request with a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` in the request body. This DTO contains a Base64 encoded audio string (`base64Audio`) and the corresponding text (`text`). The endpoint delegates the pronunciation accuracy assessment to the `PronunciationService`, specifically the `getAccuracy` method. This method uses a Feign client (`PronunciationFeignClient`) to communicate with an external service for pronunciation analysis. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` which contains detailed pronunciation accuracy information.  The endpoint wraps the response in a `BaseResponse` object before returning it to the client. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` to manage cases where the external service fails or other issues occur. The `BaseService` handles the creation of the `BaseResponse` and request ID management.",
