  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` accepts a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` as input, which presumably contains the base64 encoded audio and the corresponding text.  It uses the `PronunciationService` to process this request. The service converts the request to a `PronunciationAccuracyRequest` object, sets the language to \"en\", and sends it to a remote service (`pronunciationFeignClient.getAccuracyFromRecordedAudio`). The response from the remote service is then converted back into a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned wrapped in a `BaseResponse`. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` for cases where the remote service returns null. The `BaseResponse` provides a standardized response format including request ID and success/failure status.",
