  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a pronunciation accuracy request containing base64 encoded audio and the corresponding text. It uses the `pronunciationService` to process this request. The service uses a Feign client (`pronunciationFeignClient`) to send the request to an external service for pronunciation analysis. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned.  The endpoint uses a `BaseResponse` wrapper to handle success and failure scenarios, including adding a request ID for tracing.  Error handling includes catching `BusinessException` which likely represents errors from the external service or internal processing issues. Logging is implemented using AOP to log both requests and responses, including redaction of sensitive data.",

      "explain": "The endpoint fulfills this requirement by accepting audio and text.  The detailed assessment is dependent on the external service's response, which is not fully detailed in the provided code.  The score is reduced slightly due to the lack of explicit detail on the comprehensiveness of the accuracy report in the code."

The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said. An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced. The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech. A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Needs Improvement\"). A numerical score representing my pronunciation accuracy. The exact original text and its phonetic representation that I was supposed to say.",
