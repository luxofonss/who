Without this code, it's impossible to describe the endpoint's functionality, request structure, validation, response, or internal workings. The existing code shows authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT filter), exception handling, and logging aspects, but these are not directly related to the missing pronunciation endpoint.\",\n  \"requirement_coverage\": [],\n  \"test_cases\": [],\n  \"improvements\": []\n}\n```\n"
