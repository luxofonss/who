  "document": "The provided code implements a REST API for managing quizzes.  The endpoint `/api/v1/quizzes` handles various operations related to quizzes, including creation, update, retrieval (by ID, user, and public quizzes), deletion, saving, and managing quiz attempts.  The `/api/v1/pub/quizzes` endpoint provides a public-facing interface for retrieving all public quizzes. The implementation uses Spring Boot, JPA, and various mapper interfaces for data transformation.  It also incorporates exception handling, logging, and authentication using a `UserPrincipal` object.",

The 'username' and 'password' fields must not be null or empty. If authentication is successful, the API must return a 200 OK response with access and refresh JWT tokens. If authentication fails (e.g., wrong username/password), the API must return a exception. All failed login attempts must be logged with the attempted username and reason for failure.",

Add logging for failed login attempts, including the username and reason for failure. Consider using Spring Security for a robust authentication solution."
