  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/biz/test/hello` (although the provided code doesn't directly map to this endpoint, it's implied that the `getAccuracy` method is accessible via a POST request to a similar path) processes pronunciation accuracy requests.  It receives a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` containing base64 encoded audio and text. The request is mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyRequest` object, sent to a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably an external service), and the response is mapped back to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` before being wrapped in a `BaseResponse` for return.  Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` for internal errors and `HttpStatusCodeException` for external service errors.  A custom AOP handler logs requests and responses, including redaction of sensitive data.",
