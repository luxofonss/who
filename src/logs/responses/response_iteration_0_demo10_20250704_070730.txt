  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a pronunciation accuracy request containing base64 encoded audio and text. It uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` to forward the request to an external service for pronunciation analysis. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned as part of a `BaseResponse` object.  Error handling is implemented for cases where the external service returns null or throws exceptions.  The `BaseResponse` includes metadata such as request ID, status code, and error messages.",
  "requirement_coverage": [
    {
      "requirement": "As a Language Learner, I want to submit my spoken audio and text so that I can receive a detailed assessment of my pronunciation accuracy.",
      "coverage_score": 100,
      "explain": "The endpoint accepts base64 encoded audio and text as input and returns a detailed pronunciation accuracy report including start and end times, IPA script, accuracy indicators, matched transcripts, accuracy category, numerical score, and the original text and its phonetic representation.  The `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` contains all the required fields."

    {
      "requirement": "When my pronunciation analysis cannot be completed (e.g., the external service we rely on is unavailable), I should receive a clear message indicating that the accuracy assessment failed.",
      "coverage_score": 100,
      "explain": "The code explicitly handles the case where `pronunciationFeignClient.getAccuracyFromRecordedAudio(req)` returns null, throwing a `BusinessException` with `ErrorConstant.GET_PRONUNCIATION_ACCURACY_ERROR`. This exception is caught by the global exception handler and returns an appropriate error response."

      "coverage_score": 100,
      "explain": "This test case is covered.  The endpoint processes the request and returns a response based on the external service's output.  A successful response from the external service will result in a high accuracy score."

      "test_case": "TC-PA-002: Verify that the API correctly processes audio with minor deviations or a noticeable accent, providing a non-perfect but reasonable score.",
      "coverage_score": 100,

      "coverage_score": 100,

      "coverage_score": 50,
      "explain": "This is not explicitly handled in the provided code.  The external service might handle it, or it might throw an exception that is caught by the generic exception handler.  More specific error handling is needed."

      "coverage_score": 100,
      "explain": "This test case is covered. The external service is responsible for comparing the audio and text, and returning a low accuracy score if they don't match."

  "improvements": [
    {
      "type": "Error Handling",
      "reason": "The current error handling is too generic.  It doesn't handle specific issues like invalid Base64 audio, empty audio, empty text, or large audio/text inputs.",
      "solution": "Add specific input validation for Base64 audio and text fields (length, format, etc.).  Handle these validation errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.  Implement more robust error handling for exceptions thrown by the external service, providing more informative error messages to the user."

    {
      "type": "Input Validation",
      "reason": "Missing input validation for audio and text size limits.",
      "solution": "Add validation to check the size of the audio and text inputs and return an appropriate error response if the limits are exceeded."

    {
      "type": "Logging",
      "reason": "While logging is present, it could be improved by including more context, such as the specific error from the external service.",
      "solution": "Enhance logging to include more detailed information about the request and response from the external service, including any errors encountered."
