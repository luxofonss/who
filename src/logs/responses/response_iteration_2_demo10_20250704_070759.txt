  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a pronunciation accuracy request containing base64 encoded audio and text. It uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` to delegate the actual pronunciation analysis to an external service. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned wrapped in a `BaseResponse`.  Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` for internal errors and `HttpStatusCodeException` for errors from the external service.  The response always includes metadata such as request ID and status codes. Logging is implemented using AOP.",

    {
      "type": "Documentation",
      "reason": "The API documentation should clearly specify the expected format and constraints for the input parameters.",
      "solution": "Add comprehensive API documentation specifying input constraints (e.g., maximum audio size, maximum text length, Base64 encoding requirements) and expected response formats."
