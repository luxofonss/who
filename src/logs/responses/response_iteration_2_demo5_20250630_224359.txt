  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio and text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to send this data to an external service (`PronunciationFeignClient`) for pronunciation accuracy analysis. The response from the external service is mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object.  The `BaseResponse` includes metadata such as a request ID and error handling information. Error handling within the `PronunciationService` checks for null responses from the external service and throws a `BusinessException` if the external service fails.  The `BaseService` handles the creation of the `BaseResponse` object and adds request ID metadata. The `BusinessException` is caught by a global exception handler which provides a standardized error response.",
