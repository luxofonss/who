  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` accepts a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` as input, which presumably contains the audio recording (likely as a Base64 encoded string) and the corresponding text.  It uses the `PronunciationService` to process this request. The service uses a `pronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for communication with an external pronunciation analysis service) to get the accuracy. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object.  Error handling is implemented by catching potential exceptions from the external service and returning a `BusinessException` with an appropriate error code. The `BaseResponse` provides a standardized response format including metadata like request ID and status codes.",

Implement more comprehensive error handling to catch and appropriately handle exceptions from the external service, providing informative error messages to the user.  Consider using a more specific exception type than `RuntimeException`."

      "type": "External Service Integration",
      "reason": "The code heavily relies on an external service whose response structure is unknown.  This makes testing and ensuring complete requirement coverage difficult.",
      "solution": "Provide the contract (interface or DTOs) for the external pronunciation service.  Mock the external service for testing purposes to isolate the endpoint's logic."

    {
      "type": "Response Structure",
      "reason": "The `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` is not fully defined, making it impossible to verify if it meets all the requirements.",
      "solution": "Provide the complete definition of `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` to ensure it includes all the necessary fields (start/end time, phonetic transcription, individual sound accuracy, matched words, accuracy categorization, numerical score, original text and its phonetic representation)."
