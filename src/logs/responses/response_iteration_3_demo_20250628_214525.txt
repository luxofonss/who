  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio and text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a third-party pronunciation API) to perform the actual analysis.  The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID for traceability. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` which provides error codes and messages. The `LogsActivityAOPHandler` aspect logs both requests and responses.",
