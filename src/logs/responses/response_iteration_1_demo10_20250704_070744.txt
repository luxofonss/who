  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a pronunciation accuracy request containing base64 encoded audio and text. It uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` to forward the request to an external pronunciation service. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned as part of a `BaseResponse` object.  Error handling is implemented for cases where the external service returns null or throws exceptions.  The `LogsActivityAOPHandler` aspect logs both requests and responses, including potential errors.",

The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech. A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Needs Improvement\").
