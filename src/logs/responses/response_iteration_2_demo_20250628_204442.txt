  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio and text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a third-party pronunciation API) to perform the actual analysis. The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID for traceability.  The `PronunciationMapper` handles data transformation between DTOs and the requests/responses of the external service. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` which is caught and handled by a global exception handler.",
