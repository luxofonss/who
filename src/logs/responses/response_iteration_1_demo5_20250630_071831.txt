The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a remote service) to send the audio and text for analysis. The response from the remote service is mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned in a `BaseResponse` object.  The `BaseResponse` includes metadata such as request ID and error handling information.",
