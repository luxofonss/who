  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio string and corresponding text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a remote service) to perform the actual pronunciation analysis. The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID for traceability.  Error handling is implemented for cases where the external service returns null, throwing a `BusinessException` which is caught and handled by a global exception handler.",
