  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio string and corresponding text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a third-party pronunciation API) to perform the actual analysis.  The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID for traceability.  Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` which is caught by a global exception handler. The response includes detailed pronunciation information or an error message if the analysis fails.",

      "type": "Error Handling",
      "reason": "While `BusinessException` is used, the specific error messages returned to the client could be more informative and user-friendly.",
      "solution": "Improve error messages returned in `BusinessException` to provide more context to the user about why the pronunciation analysis failed. Consider using a more sophisticated error handling mechanism, such as returning different HTTP status codes based on the type of error."

    {
      "type": "Response DTO",
      "reason": "The response DTO uses `Object` which is not type-safe.  The response should be more specific.",

    {
      "type": "Logging",
      "reason": "While logging is present, it might not capture all relevant information for debugging purposes, especially in case of failures.",
      "solution": "Enhance logging to include more details about the request (e.g., audio size, text length) and the response from the external service, including any errors.  Consider using structured logging for better searchability and analysis."

    {
      "type": "Resilience",
      "reason": "The reliance on an external service introduces a single point of failure.  The system should be more resilient.",
      "solution": "Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers around the `pronunciationFeignClient` calls to improve the system's resilience to external service outages.  Consider caching successful results to reduce the load on the external service."
