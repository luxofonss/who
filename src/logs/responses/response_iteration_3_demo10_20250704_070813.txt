  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a pronunciation accuracy request containing base64 encoded audio and text. It uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` to forward the request to an external pronunciation service. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned as part of a `BaseResponse` object.  Error handling is implemented for various scenarios, including null responses from the external service and various exceptions.",

      "explain": "The endpoint accepts a request body with `base64Audio` and `text` fields, processes it using an external service, and returns a detailed `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` containing start/end times, IPA transcriptions, accuracy scores, and matched transcripts.  The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` for consistent error handling."

The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said. An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced. The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech. A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Needs Improvement\").

    {
      "type": "Error Handling",
      "reason": "The generic exception handler catches many exceptions.  More specific error handling would provide better diagnostics and user feedback.",
      "solution": "Implement more specific exception handlers for issues like malformed Base64 strings or network errors when communicating with the external service.  Provide more informative error messages to the user."

    {
      "type": "Size Limits",
      "reason": "The API doesn't handle potential size limits for audio and text inputs.",

    {
      "type": "Logging",
      "reason": "While logging is present, more detailed logging around the external service calls would aid in debugging and monitoring.",
      "solution": "Add more detailed logging around the `pronunciationFeignClient` calls, including request and response details, and any exceptions encountered."
