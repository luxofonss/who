It uses the `pronunciationService` to send this data to an external service (`pronunciationFeignClient`) for pronunciation accuracy analysis. The response from the external service is then mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and returned within a `BaseResponse`.  The service handles potential errors from the external service by throwing a `BusinessException` which is caught by a global exception handler.",
