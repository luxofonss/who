  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio and text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a third-party pronunciation API) to perform the actual analysis. The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID for traceability.  The `PronunciationMapper` handles data transformation between the request/response DTOs and the internal/external API request/response objects. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException`, which provides error codes and messages.  AOP logging is in place to capture request and response details.",
