  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` is a POST endpoint that accepts a `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` in the request body. This request object presumably contains the audio recording (likely as a Base64 encoded string) and the corresponding text. The endpoint delegates the pronunciation accuracy analysis to the `pronunciationService.getAccuracy` method. This method uses a `pronunciationMapper` to transform the request DTO into a request object suitable for an external service (`pronunciationFeignClient`). The external service (`pronunciationFeignClient.getAccuracyFromRecordedAudio`) performs the actual pronunciation analysis and returns a `PronunciationAccuracyResponse`.  The response is then mapped back to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` using the `pronunciationMapper` and returned as part of a `BaseResponse<Object>` object.  Error handling is implemented by checking for a null response from the external service, throwing a `BusinessException` if the analysis fails. The `BaseResponse` handles the packaging of the response with metadata such as request ID and status codes.",
