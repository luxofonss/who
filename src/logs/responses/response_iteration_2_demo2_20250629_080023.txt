  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/samples` is a GET endpoint that retrieves a pronunciation sample. It takes a `GetSampleRequestDto` as input, which contains a `PronunciationLevel` and an optional `customText`. The service uses a `PronunciationMapper` to translate the request into a `GetSampleRequest` object, sets the language to \"en\", and sends it to a `PronunciationFeignClient` to fetch the sample. The response from the client, a `GetSampleResponse`, is then mapped back to a `GetPronunciationSampleResponseDto` using the `PronunciationMapper` and returned.  Error handling is implemented using a `BusinessException` if the response from the feign client is null.",
