  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio and text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a `PronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client for a third-party pronunciation API) to perform the actual analysis.  The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID for traceability.  Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException`, which provides error codes and messages. The `LogsActivityAOPHandler` aspect logs both requests and responses, including request IDs and headers.",

      "type": "Input Validation",
      "reason": "The API lacks validation for audio and text size limits.",
      "solution": "Add validation to `PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto` to enforce size limits for `base64Audio` and `text` fields.  Return appropriate error responses if limits are exceeded."

    {
      "type": "Resilience",
      "reason": "The reliance on an external service introduces a single point of failure.  If the external service is unavailable, the entire feature fails.",
      "solution": "Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers around the `pronunciationFeignClient` calls to improve resilience.  Consider caching successful pronunciation analysis results to reduce the load on the external service."

    {
      "type": "Documentation",
      "reason": "The documentation should clearly specify the expected format and constraints of the input data (Base64 audio and text).",
      "solution": "Add comprehensive documentation to the API specification (e.g., Swagger) detailing the input format, size limits, and error responses."
