  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio string and corresponding text via a POST request. It uses the `PronunciationService` to assess pronunciation accuracy.  The service uses a `pronunciationFeignClient` (presumably a Feign client) to communicate with an external service for pronunciation analysis. The response from the external service is mapped to a `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object before being returned to the client.  Error handling is implemented to catch cases where the external service returns null, throwing a `BusinessException`.",

However, the details of the assessment (e.g., specific phonetic information, timestamps) are not visible in the provided code and depend on the `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and the external service's response."

The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said. An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced. The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech. A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Needs Improvement\"). A numerical score representing my pronunciation accuracy. The exact original text and its phonetic representation that I was supposed to say.",
