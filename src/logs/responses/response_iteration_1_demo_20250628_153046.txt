  "document": "The endpoint `/api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy` receives a base64 encoded audio string and text as input. It uses the `pronunciationService` to assess the pronunciation accuracy. The service uses a feign client (`pronunciationFeignClient`) to communicate with an external service for pronunciation analysis.  The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object, including a request ID. Error handling is implemented using `BusinessException` for cases where the external service fails or returns null. The response includes a detailed accuracy report if successful, or an error message if the analysis fails.",

      "requirement": "As a Language Learner, I want to submit my spoken audio and text so that I can receive a detailed assessment of my pronunciation accuracy.",

      "explain": "The endpoint accepts base64 audio and text via POST request.  The `pronunciationService` processes this data and returns a detailed accuracy report (assuming `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` contains the required details as specified in the acceptance criteria).  The response is wrapped in a `BaseResponse` object."

      "requirement": "When I submit this audio and text to the system, Then the system should process my submission to determine pronunciation accuracy.",
      "coverage_score": 100,

    {
      "requirement": "And the system must provide a comprehensive accuracy report including: When my pronunciation started and ended within the audio. The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said. An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced. The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech. A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Needs Improvement\"). A numerical score representing my pronunciation accuracy. The exact original text and its phonetic representation that I was supposed to say.",
      "coverage_score": 90,
      "explain": "The code's coverage of this requirement depends entirely on the implementation of `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and the external service.  The provided context only shows that a response is returned; it doesn't guarantee the response contains all the specified details.  We need to inspect `PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto` and the external service's response structure to confirm full coverage."

      "explain": "The `pronunciationService` handles null responses from `pronunciationFeignClient` by throwing a `BusinessException`.  The `BaseService` likely translates this exception into a structured error response (assuming appropriate error handling in `BaseResponse`)."

      "reason": "Heavy reliance on an external service without robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.",
