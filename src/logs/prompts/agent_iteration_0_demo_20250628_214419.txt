You are an expert software architect analyzing the REST endpoint: /api/v1/pub/pronunciations/accuracy
            Your first job is to apply the strategy above
             ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
            1. Review the current context for the endpoint implementation
            2. Get all classes, services, repositories, DTOs, methods and check if they are fully implemented
            3. If you see references to any classes, services, DTOs, or methods that are not fully shown, request more context using the tool
            4. When there are no classes, services, DTOs, or methods that are not fully shown, you have sufficient implementation details, provide your final analysis as JSON. 
            5. Do not assume that you have enough context, always check the code and use get_project_code_context if any part of the code is not fully implemented.

            WHEN TO USE get_project_code_context TOOL:
            - When you see class/interface names without their implementation
            - When service methods are referenced but not shown
            - When DTO/model classes are mentioned but structure is unclear
            - When exception handling classes are referenced
            - When you need to understand dependencies or business logic

            To use the tool, respond with: "I need to get context for [exact_class_or_method_name]"
            Examples:
            - "I need to get context for UserService"
            - "I need to get context for ValidationException"
            - "I need to get context for OrderDto"

            CURRENT CONTEXT:
            # Summary: 
@PostMapping("/accuracy")
    public BaseResponse<Object> getAccuracy(@RequestBody PronunciationAccuracyRequestDto request) {
        return baseService.ofSucceeded(pronunciationService.getAccuracy(request));
    }

public <T> BaseResponse<T> ofSucceeded(T data) {
        return BaseResponse.ofSucceeded(getRequestId(), data);

public static <T> BaseResponse<T> ofSucceeded(String requestId) {
        BaseResponse<T> response = ofSucceeded();
        response.meta.setRequestId(requestId);
        return response;

public String getRequestId() {
        return getRequestValue(RequestKeyConstant.REQUEST_ID).toString();

public <T> T getRequestValue(String key, Class<T> clazz) {
        return clazz.cast(httpServletRequest.getAttribute(key));

            REQUIREMENTS TO ANALYZE:
            Sprint Planning for Pronunciation Accuracy: A Business Perspective
Our team is embarking on a new sprint, focusing on enhancing our language learning platform. A key initiative for this sprint is to deliver a robust Pronunciation Accuracy Feature. The goal is to provide our users with immediate and detailed feedback on their spoken language, helping them improve their pronunciation and build confidence.

Product Vision for Pronunciation Accuracy
"To empower our users with precise, instant feedback on their pronunciation, fostering a more effective and engaging language learning experience."

User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
User Story: As a Language Learner, I want to submit my spoken audio and text so that I can receive a detailed assessment of my pronunciation accuracy.
Description: Our users need a way to practice speaking and immediately understand how well they pronounced specific words or phrases. This direct feedback is crucial for self-correction and progress tracking.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given I have an audio recording of my speech and the corresponding text I intended to say,

When I submit this audio and text to the system,

Then the system should process my submission to determine pronunciation accuracy.

And the system must provide a comprehensive accuracy report including:

When my pronunciation started and ended within the audio.

The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said.

An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced.

The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech.

A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., "Excellent," "Good," "Needs Improvement").

A numerical score representing my pronunciation accuracy.

The exact original text and its phonetic representation that I was supposed to say.

And if for any reason the pronunciation analysis cannot be completed (e.g., the external service we rely on is unavailable), I should receive a clear message indicating that the accuracy assessment failed.

            TEST CASES TO VERIFY:
            Positive Test Cases:
TC-PA-001: Verify that the API correctly processes a high-quality audio submission with perfectly pronounced text.

TC-PA-002: Verify that the API correctly processes audio with minor deviations or a noticeable accent, providing a non-perfect but reasonable score.

Negative & Edge Test Cases:
TC-PA-003: Verify that the API gracefully handles the scenario where the external pronunciation service is down or unresponsive.

TC-PA-004: Verify that the API handles an invalid or corrupted Base64 audio string.

TC-PA-005: Verify that the API handles an empty Base64 audio string.

TC-PA-006: Verify that the API handles an empty text field.

TC-PA-007: Verify that the API processes audio and text that do not match, returning a low accuracy score.

Data Integrity & Constraints Test Cases:
TC-PA-008: Test the API's behavior with an audio file that approaches or exceeds expected size limits.

TC-PA-009: Test the API's behavior with a very long text input.

            ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
            

           
            If you dont have enough context, call the get_project_code_context tool to get more context, don't assume.
            If you have enough context, provide your final analysis as valid JSON with this structure:
            {
                "document": "detailed explanation of what the endpoint does",
                "requirement_coverage": [
                    {
                        "requirement": "exact requirement text",
                        "coverage_score": "0-100",
                        "explain": "how the code meets or fails this requirement"
                    }
                ],
                "test_cases": [
                    {
                        "test_case": "exact test case text",
                        "coverage_score": "0-100", 
                        "explain": "whether this test case is covered by the implementation"
                    }
                ],
                "improvements": [
                    {
                        "type": "category",
                        "reason": "what needs improvement",
                        "solution": "recommended fix"
                    }
                ]
            }

            Do not assume any code logic, always check the code and use get_project_code_context if any part of the code is not fully implemented.
