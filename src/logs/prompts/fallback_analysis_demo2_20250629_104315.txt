Sprint Planning for Pronunciation Accuracy: A Business Perspective
Our team is embarking on a new sprint, focusing on enhancing our language learning platform. A key initiative for this sprint is to deliver a robust Pronunciation Accuracy Feature. The goal is to provide our users with immediate and detailed feedback on their spoken language, helping them improve their pronunciation and build confidence.

Product Vision for Pronunciation Accuracy
"To empower our users with precise, instant feedback on their pronunciation, fostering a more effective and engaging language learning experience."

User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
User Story: As a Language Learner, I want to submit my spoken audio and text so that I can receive a detailed assessment of my pronunciation accuracy.
Description: Our users need a way to practice speaking and immediately understand how well they pronounced specific words or phrases. This direct feedback is crucial for self-correction and progress tracking.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given I have an audio recording of my speech and the corresponding text I intended to say,

When I submit this audio and text to the system,

Then the system should process my submission to determine pronunciation accuracy.

And the system must provide a comprehensive accuracy report including:

When my pronunciation started and ended within the audio.

The phonetic representation (IPA script) of what I said.

An indication of whether all individual sounds were correctly pronounced.

The words and their phonetic forms that the system matched to my speech.

A categorization of my overall pronunciation accuracy (e.g., "Excellent," "Good," "Needs Improvement").

A numerical score representing my pronunciation accuracy.

The exact original text and its phonetic representation that I was supposed to say.

And if for any reason the pronunciation analysis cannot be completed (e.g., the external service we rely on is unavailable), I should receive a clear message indicating that the accuracy assessment failed.

Test cases:
Positive Test Cases:
TC-PA-001: Verify that the API correctly processes a high-quality audio submission with perfectly pronounced text.

TC-PA-002: Verify that the API correctly processes audio with minor deviations or a noticeable accent, providing a non-perfect but reasonable score.

Negative & Edge Test Cases:
TC-PA-003: Verify that the API gracefully handles the scenario where the external pronunciation service is down or unresponsive.

TC-PA-004: Verify that the API handles an invalid or corrupted Base64 audio string.

TC-PA-005: Verify that the API handles an empty Base64 audio string.

TC-PA-006: Verify that the API handles an empty text field.

TC-PA-007: Verify that the API processes audio and text that do not match, returning a low accuracy score.

Data Integrity & Constraints Test Cases:
TC-PA-008: Test the API's behavior with an audio file that approaches or exceeds expected size limits.

TC-PA-009: Test the API's behavior with a very long text input.

Additional instructions:
check PronunciationAccuracyResponseDto, pronunciationserviceimpl and all related codes and configuration
